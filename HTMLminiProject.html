      <h2>2. About Me<h/2>
      <p><small>Welcome to my HTML5 page. My name is Alexandria Meilan; my preferred name is Alex. I am a student at CodingTemple completing my certifcation in software engineering with the specialty of backend developement. I am also attending the University of New Mexico and completing my CompTIA certifications in Information Technology. My mother is from Spain and my father is from Cuba and his parent's were Spanish immigrants. I spent the first years of my life living in South Florida, New Hampshire, and then Los Angeles, Califorina. ; I currently reside in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am deeply proud of my Spanish roots.</small></p>
      <p><small>My educational background:</small></p>
      <ul>
        <li><small>Miami-Dade College, Associates of Arts in Music Education</small></li>
        <li><small>Miami-Dade College, Associates of Science in Music Business</small></li>
        <li><small>Florida International University, Bachelor's of Arts in East Asian Studies w/specialty in Economics Track</small></li>
        <li><small>Southern New Hampshire University, Master's of Science in Applied Economics and Statistics w/specialty Econometrics Track</small></li>
      </ul>

      <h2><small>Career Goals</small></h2>
      <p><small>My career goal is to essentially become a backend software engineer. My other goal is to build websites and apps on the side. One goal of mine is to build my video game titled "Wyoming Tales", which is a horror survival with puzzles. The video game script is already completed. I'd best describe the project as "Dead by Daylight" meets "Resident Evil".</small></p>

      <h2><small>Personal Interests</small></h2>
      <p><small>Other than anything related to technology, I love music. I play piano and I enjoy composing music. One of my goals later on in my life is to finish my BA in music composition. I am only 5 classes away from getting my BA in music. Other than music, I enjoy learning different languages. I am currently learning Italian and Dutch; I embrace and love diversity, especially embracing different cuisines at home such making Thai and Malaysian foods. Lastly, one major interest of mine is being involved in the political process. I am a progressive Democrat and I like getting involved with environmental causes and LGBTQ causes, especially protecting transgender individuals. Bigotry is something that I do not support and I proudly champion against it. No human being on this planet has a right to cause another human being harm. I intend to run for a political position (House of Representatives) in the future as a bold, progressive Democrat. </small></p>
